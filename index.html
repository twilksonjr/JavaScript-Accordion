                    <p>Javascript, was originally called Mocha, later it was named to LiveScript, and then to
                        Javascript.
                        <br>
                        <br>The language was then submitted for standardization to the ECMA International Organization.
                        By that time, Netscape
                        didn't allow the use of the "Javascript" name, so the standardized language is ECMAScript.
